# Driver-Monitoring-Study
A Study on the Estimation and Monitoring of Driver's Eyes for the Realization of Self-Driving Technology

(1)Driver gaze estimation and caution-only accident prevention system through deep learning

We use "pupil" to track the driver's gaze. And we use azure to track the direction of the driver's head. Through this, the driver's gaze and head direction estimate situations in which the driver closes his eyes for a long time or the driver is unable to concentrate on driving. Based on this, the system first alerts the driver. Furthermore, the information is passed over to the driver around them via communication and visualized on the GUI.
